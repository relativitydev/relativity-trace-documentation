### Non-Alerted Document Review Report
Companies can track when surveillance team members view communications that have not been alerted on to identify scenarios where compliance team members are abusing their access to view employees communications. Trace will send an email report or real-time notifications regarding these privacy issues where reviewers are looking at non-alerted documents.
