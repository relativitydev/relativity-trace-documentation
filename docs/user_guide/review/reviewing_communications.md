## Overview
When clicking on a Document within Relativity Trace, the Document Viewer will display that communication in its native format. The Viewer supports the display of more than 900 different file types and is consistent across formats. More information on the Viewer can be found [here](https://help.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/Relativity/Viewer/Viewer.htm).

If you want this functionality enabled please contact support.

### Fields

Several fields are included to assist in reviewing communications.

#### Email Action

There is a field called `Trace Email Action` that describes what type of email each email is. This field can be set to the following choices:

1. Empty (if this field is left empty, this means that this is not an email)
2. Draft
3. Send
4. Forward
5. Reply
6. Reply-All

No setup is needed for this field; it will be populated automatically when the file is imported.
