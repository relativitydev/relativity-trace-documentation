## Overview
Data Sources are used to automatically and continously collect and ingest communication channel data into Relativity Trace. Relativity Trace supports all essential data sources across email, chat, voice, mobile, collaboration, Archive channels both located in the cloud and on-premises. New data sources are being added in each release and can be added upon request.

## Configuring a Data Source
Data Sources are configured by a Relativity Trace Administrator. They are configured both during implementation and ad-hoc when monitoring needs to be extended to a new communication channel. Administrator information on how to configure a Data Source can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/data_sources.md %}).
