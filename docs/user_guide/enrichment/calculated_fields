## Overview

Trace provides out-of-the-box calcualted fields to improve the uncover real risk, reduce review time, and build confidence. 

What does this mean for you? Trace goes beyond lexicon-based surveillance systems with powerful AI models specifically designed to uncover true risk and reduce review time. Trace AI models learn and improve over time, delivering smarter alerts your compliance team can rely on. And with fully transparent results, analysts will understand the alerts and compliance teams can easily explain outcomes to stakeholders.

## Fields
Document fields are created for each enrichment method. These document fields can be used as part of the Omit from Alert Rules functionality or Rules. See more information on AI fields [here](https://relativitydev.github.io/relativity-trace-documentation/docs/administrator_guide/fields.html).

Fields are populated automatically, there is not transformation or action requried
