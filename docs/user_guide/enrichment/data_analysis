## Overview

Trace provides out-of-the-box fields that can be completed with data analysis to improve the uncover real risk, reduce review time, and build confidence. 

What does this mean for you? Trace goes beyond lexicon-based surveillance systems with powerful AI models specifically designed to uncover true risk and reduce review time. Trace AI models learn and improve over time, delivering smarter alerts your compliance team can rely on. And with fully transparent results, analysts will understand the alerts and compliance teams can easily explain outcomes to stakeholders.


## Types of Enrichment

### Reduce Review Time
| **Trace Feature**       | **Description**                                |**Implementation**                           | **Fields** |
| ------------------------| -----------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Spam Detection          | Identifies spam and not spam communications    | Map field to coding panel (must add to [Omit from Alert Rules](https://relativitydev.github.io/relativity-trace-documentation/docs/administrator_guide/alerting/omit_from_alert_rules.html) to prevent spam from being alerted on) |Trace Is Spam|
| Text Cleansing          | Identifies non-authored or duplicative content | See [Data Transformations](https://relativitydev.github.io/relativity-trace-documentation/docs/administrator_guide/enrichment/data_transforms.html#ai-extracted-text-cleansing-data-transformation) |Trace Primary Language, Trace Other Languages, Trace Language Switching Detected|
| Replace                 | Strip exact blocks of text out of the Extracted Text for any documents imported by the associated Data Source| Data Transformation |             |
| Deduplication           | prevent a Data Source from importing an original document and its extractions if the same document already exists in the workspace| Data Transformation |Deduplication |
| Exempt List             | prevent a Data Source from importing communnivatio due to Username, Domain, or Email Address| Data Transformation | Trace Exempt       |
| Conversation Thread     | Relational field making it where documents within the same thread as a document shown in the Viewer will be displayed in the Relational Pane| Data Transformation |          |

### Uncover Real Risk

| Coercion & Intimidation | Detect persuasion through force or threats     | Please contact Trace Support to Implement   |na          |
| Mirror Trading          | Detect simultaneous buy and sell trades of the same stock on different exchanges by the same entity, as a way to move money between jurisdictions| Please contact Trace Support to Implement   |na          |

## Fields
Document fields are created for each enrichment method. These document fields can be used as part of the Omit from Alert Rules functionality or Rules. See more information on AI fields [here](https://relativitydev.github.io/relativity-trace-documentation/docs/administrator_guide/fields.html).

Fields are populated automatically, there is not transformation or action requried
