# 12.0.4.2 (16 October 2019)

**Relativity Compatibility**

- \> 9.6.202.10

**Features**

- New Data Enrichment Task performs data extraction independently of data retrieval, allows for better throughput and scalability of data ingestion pipeline
- Trace Agents (Manager and Worker) now fully support resource pools which allows to designate multiple agent servers to scale out Trace workflow as needed

**Enhancements**

- Rule Type field can now be specified per rule. This allows to tag different MO field depending on rule configuration. Workflow rule configuration are used to drive workflow within the Relativity workspace
  Alert rule configuration is used for standard e-com/a-com identification
- Eliminated redundant query/read audits generated by Trace operations which reduces pressure on SQL server and audit infrastructure
- All actions associated with any rule now operate on net new data that is reflected on dedicated saved search
  - RelativityScript (advanced) action now operates on the same saved search, yielding incremental data only
- Conceptual and Classification index automation now takes into account any in-progress activities that lock the index resulting in better robustness
- dtSearch indexes will now perform Full Build automatically (no user interaction) on newly created indexes that are subject to automation
- Data Transformation failures on set of docs (in data batch) now reports detailed per document failures and allows for partial import of successful transformations
- Application installation time is now significantly faster, per workspace upgrade logic now is done by the Trace Manager agent
- BIST testing coverage is now expanded to include:
  - Explicit tests of successful Data Retention action execution
  - Monitored Individual auto-discovery propagation
  - Ingestion flow via Integration Points (as production)
- Monitored Individuals can now take advantage of Secondary Identifier to accommodate variable identifiers across multiple data sources (see documentation)

**Defect Fixes**

- Long text truncation of ingestion state for data sources with large number of Monitored Individuals when updating via UI
- Continuous BIST execution no longer generates orphaned resources and now correctly notifies of errors via Reporting task
- BIST import dependencies were updated to be compatible with RelOne Goatsbeard (10.3+) release
- Monitored Individual Auto-discovery no longer breaks the whole data batch on failures and reports errors on all extracted documents. Additionally, discovered monitored individuals are now properly associated with all documents that were extracted (including sub-attachments)

**Deprecated**

- Tag Action is now explicitly done as part of every rule evaluation and is not available in UI

**Upgrade Considerations**

- This is a major version change of Relativity Trace.

# 11.2.11.1 (13 September 2019 - DEPRECATED)

> **DEPRECATION NOTE:** This version of Trace is **no longer supported**

**Relativity Compatibility**

- \> 9.6.202.10

**Defect Fixes**

- Fixed an issue where Email action was automatically adding trace@relativity.com to recipient list


# 11.2.10.1 (12 August 2019) - DEPRECATED

> **DEPRECATION NOTE:** This version of Trace is **no longer supported**

**Relativity Compatibility**

- \> 9.6.202.10

**Defect Fixes**

- Fixed an issue where under certain failures of Data Retrieval task, Globanet based data sources would delete retrieved data without extracting it

# 11.2.9.2 (15 July 2019) - DEPRECATED

> **DEPRECATION NOTE:** This version of Trace is **no longer supported**

**Relativity Compatibility**

- \> 9.6.202.10

**Features**

- BIST auto-run automation
- In production, you can dedicate a workspace for continuous integration
  testing and enable automatic execution of tests ensuring the infrastructure
  is in good shape
- Configuration of tasks, actions, data sources and data transformations is
  now entered and validated within text fields (instead of JSON) using the
  custom fields UI

**Enhancements**

- BIST now includes additional coverage and verification
- Reporting task and Email (alert) action now utilize kCura.Notification
  encrypted instance settings for email (SMTP) configuration
- Data Sources now report data retrieval errors directly on the Data Source
  object and no longer generate data batches with errors, reducing the number
  of failed data batches and the amount of manual resolution required
- Various performance optimizations for workspaces containing a large number
  of documents
- Additional metrics surrounding data retrieval and extraction processes are
  now added as part of Telemetry reporting
- Data Extraction can now discover monitored individuals within emails if they
  are not specified in the load file(s) generated by the Data Source
- Configuration of monitored individuals for Globanet data sources is now
  streamlined via CSV file

**Defect Fixes**

- Fixed an issue where .NET thread count (resource usage) would climb if
  Microsoft Exchange Data Source was misconfigured
- Embedded attachments inside of MS Office files and other containers are now
  correctly extracted
- Addressed feedback from security penetration testing

**Deprecated**

- Microsoft Office 365 data source (based on GraphAPI) is deprecated, use
  Microsoft Exchange data source instead

**Upgrade Considerations**

- In order to enable BIST functionality on a workspace you will need to enable
  it via *TraceWorkspaceSettings* instance setting
- Data Sources that requires source folder now required to be within the
  default workspace fileshare base folder. You must adjust the Source Path
  settings for each impacted data source to be a relative folder path within
  the default file share configured for the workspace.

# 11.2.6.1 (17 June 2019) - DEPRECATED

> **DEPRECATION NOTE:** This version of Trace is **no longer supported**

**Relativity Compatibility**

- \> 9.6.202.10

**Features**

- Ability to overwrite GUID for Group Identifier field - some instances have
  non-standard Group Identifier field

**Enhancements**

- BIST now includes testing for email message with large number of email
  addresses (more than what OI can support at the moment)

**Defect Fixes**

- Data Extraction will include full email header information. Large header
  information was previous truncated due to OI bug
  
  -  > NOTE: Relativity Viewer will still display truncated header
    information, however relativity fields (EmailTo, EmailFrom,
    EmailCC, EmailBCC will have full non-truncated data)
- App Installation now will fail properly if expected Group Identifier fields is
  not present in the workspace

**Deprecated**

- Microsoft Office 365 data source (based on GraphAPI) is deprecated, use
  Microsoft Exchange data source instead

**Upgrade Considerations**

- In order to enable BIST functionality on a workspace you will need to enable
  it via *TraceWorkspaceSettings* instance setting
- Data Sources that requires source folder now required to be within the
  default workspace fileshare base folder. You must adjust the Source Path
  settings for each impacted data source to be a relative folder path within
  the default file share configured for the workspace.

# 11.2.4.4 (10 June 2019) - DEPRECATED
