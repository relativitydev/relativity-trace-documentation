# 11.2.11.1 (13 September 2019)

**Relativity Compatibility**

- \> 9.6.202.10

**Defect Fixes**

- Fixed an issue where Email action was automatically adding trace@relativity.com to recipient list


# 11.2.10.1 (12 August 2019) - DEPRECATED

> **DEPRECATION NOTE:** This version of Trace is **no longer supported**

**Relativity Compatibility**

- \> 9.6.202.10

**Defect Fixes**

- Fixed an issue where under certain failures of Data Retrieval task, Globanet based data sources would delete retrieved data without extracting it

# 11.2.9.2 (15 July 2019) - DEPRECATED

> **DEPRECATION NOTE:** This version of Trace is **no longer supported**

**Relativity Compatibility**

- \> 9.6.202.10

**Features**

- BIST auto-run automation
- In production, you can dedicate a workspace for continuous integration
  testing and enable automatic execution of tests ensuring the infrastructure
  is in good shape
- Configuration of tasks, actions, data sources and data transformations is
  now entered and validated within text fields (instead of JSON) using the
  custom fields UI

**Enhancements**

- BIST now includes additional coverage and verification
- Reporting task and Email (alert) action now utilize kCura.Notification
  encrypted instance settings for email (SMTP) configuration
- Data Sources now report data retrieval errors directly on the Data Source
  object and no longer generate data batches with errors, reducing the number
  of failed data batches and the amount of manual resolution required
- Various performance optimizations for workspaces containing a large number
  of documents
- Additional metrics surrounding data retrieval and extraction processes are
  now added as part of Telemetry reporting
- Data Extraction can now discover monitored individuals within emails if they
  are not specified in the load file(s) generated by the Data Source
- Configuration of monitored individuals for Globanet data sources is now
  streamlined via CSV file

**Defect Fixes**

- Fixed an issue where .NET thread count (resource usage) would climb if
  Microsoft Exchange Data Source was misconfigured
- Embedded attachments inside of MS Office files and other containers are now
  correctly extracted
- Addressed feedback from security penetration testing

**Deprecated**

- Microsoft Office 365 data source (based on GraphAPI) is deprecated, use
  Microsoft Exchange data source instead

**Upgrade Considerations**

- In order to enable BIST functionality on a workspace you will need to enable
  it via *TraceWorkspaceSettings* instance setting
- Data Sources that requires source folder now required to be within the
  default workspace fileshare base folder. You must adjust the Source Path
  settings for each impacted data source to be a relative folder path within
  the default file share configured for the workspace.

# 11.2.6.1 (17 June 2019) - DEPRECATED

> **DEPRECATION NOTE:** This version of Trace is **no longer supported**

**Relativity Compatibility**

- \> 9.6.202.10

**Features**

- Ability to overwrite GUID for Group Identifier field - some instances have
  non-standard Group Identifier field

**Enhancements**

- BIST now includes testing for email message with large number of email
  addresses (more than what OI can support at the moment)

**Defect Fixes**

- Data Extraction will include full email header information. Large header
  information was previous truncated due to OI bug
  
  -  > NOTE: Relativity Viewer will still display truncated header
    information, however relativity fields (EmailTo, EmailFrom,
    EmailCC, EmailBCC will have full non-truncated data)
- App Installation now will fail properly if expected Group Identifier fields is
  not present in the workspace

**Deprecated**

- Microsoft Office 365 data source (based on GraphAPI) is deprecated, use
  Microsoft Exchange data source instead

**Upgrade Considerations**

- In order to enable BIST functionality on a workspace you will need to enable
  it via *TraceWorkspaceSettings* instance setting
- Data Sources that requires source folder now required to be within the
  default workspace fileshare base folder. You must adjust the Source Path
  settings for each impacted data source to be a relative folder path within
  the default file share configured for the workspace.

# 11.2.4.4 (10 June 2019) - DEPRECATED

> **DEPRECATION NOTE:** This version of Trace is **no longer supported**
