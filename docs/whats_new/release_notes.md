{: .info}

# 15.3.0.0 (31 May 2022)

**Features**

- Released Language ID and Spam Detection to run automatically upon ingestion, removing the need for Active Learning or Structured Analytic Sets 

**Defect Fixes**

- Fixed a known issue where the Perform Term Searching On Trace Cleansed Extracted Text checkbox does not control the text that is used for Term Searching, instead the fields set in the Trace All Documents Saved Search will still be honored. 
# 15.2.0.0 (19 April 2022)

**Enhancements**
- Simplified the process of data source creation in Trace to minimize possible configuration error, speed implementation time and reduce need for specialist support
- Enabled cloud-to-cloud support for Thomson Reuters Chat
- Introduced capabilities to accept different formats of Audio files
- Simplified AI Cleansed Text for alerting adoption

# 15.1.23.0 (15 March 2022)

**Features**

- A Reviewer can now email a monitored individual directly within the system to let them know that they are in breach of a policy or to get more information about an event.
- Communications are now classified as either being sent or received from a personal email address (gmail, yahoo, etc.), so it’s easier to identify scenarios where employees are sending corporate content outside the organization either to themselves or others.
- To accelerate the pace at which reviewers can clear alerts, we’ve added the ability to set default review decisions that are automatically populated when a communication is viewed.

**Enhancements**
 
- Improved our Password Bank functionality to specify when a document was encrypted but was successfully decrypted using one of the passwords. This allows for compliance teams to better understand the volume of communications that are being encrypted as a potential risk indicator.
- Ability to see communications that exist within the same email thread in the relational pane in the viewer after Email Thread Deduplication is performed. This reduces the need for running the Email Threading Structured Analytics operation.
- Added more detailed auditing for when a Trade Reconstruction action is performed to capture the links made between a trade and all its related communications. This enables users to review historic Trade Reconstruction results regardless of whether they’ve rerun the operation.

# 15.0.10.1 (8 February 2022)

**Features**

- Rule change report: Generate a report that can also be sent via email whenever a change is made to a rule so that compliance can monitor those who have permissions to update controls for any types of misconduct.
- System Health Report: Generate a report that can also be sent via email whenever a current task status failure occurs so that compliance can monitor system performance or if something is not working as anticipated. 
- Expanded ZipDrop data sources to be able to collect non-communication data (structured data) such as terms, trades, human resource information, or expense data.

**Enhancements**
 
- Enabled support for GSuite Cloud-to-Cloud Connection 
- A new Trace Email Action field can be used within Rules to alert differently on Sent, Forwarded, Replies, Replies to All, or Draft emails to further pinpoint risk and reduce false positive alerts
- Improved the viewer experience for cleansed block highlighting by no longer highlighting the header envelop
- Add new fields to NonAlerted Document Notification Reports

**Defect Fixes**

- Fixed an issue where block highlighting fails when switching back documents too fast

# 14.7.2.2 (20 December 2021)

- Enabled support for Slack Cloud-to-Cloud Connection 
- Developed an easy and quick way to view what data soruce a document is sourced from

**Defect Fixes**

- Fixed Persistent Highlighting issue where go to next highlight functionality does not work when block highlighting is collapsed

# 13.3.0.18 (5 February 2021)

**Features**

- You can now mark repetitive extracted documents, like those company logo images that are included in email signatures on every email, so they are no longer ingested into your workspace to reduce document volumes and noise in the system.
- Ensure that custom scripts, analytics, and other pre-calculations complete prior to analyzing a document for an alert by setting a `Normalized Saved Search` on the `Rule Evaluation` task.
- Remove irrelevant content like spam, exempt communications, email blasts, and specific file types up front before running alert analysis to increase performance and reduce the complexity of your Rule saved searches.

**Enhancements**

**Enhancements**

- Global Dt Search Index build errors are now reported on the Trace Indexing Task to increase awareness of impactful failures
- Noise words are now omitted by default when creating a new dtSearch Index

- Fixed issue where Exempt List entries of the “Email Address” Type considered character case when matching communication From values
- Copy and Replace mass operations have been removed from Rules, Terms, Monitored Individuals, Actions, and Data Batches to prevent creating objects with the same name or accidental linking between objects that are not related

**Deprecated**

- Copy mass action is no longer available for the Data Source RDO type

**Upgrade Considerations**

- All Office 365 customers should migrate to use of OAuth 2.0. Microsoft will no longer allow basic username/password authentication in O365 starting in October 2020 and Data Sources using it will begin failing. Review [Relativity Trace Authorization](https://relativitydev.github.io/relativity-trace-documentation/authorization) documentation for OAuth 2.0 information.

**Deprecated**

- The "Term Category" object type is no longer associated with or used by the Trace application (schema for the object type and all data will remain in existing Trace workspaces, nothing will be deleted)
- Removed support for the undocumented File Share data source type

**Upgrade Considerations**

- Update an existing Term view or create a new one if you would like to display the now orphaned "Term Category" field

  streamlined via CSV file

**Defect Fixes**

- Fixed an issue where .NET thread count (resource usage) would climb if
  Microsoft Exchange Data Source was misconfigured
- Embedded attachments inside of MS Office files and other containers are now
  correctly extracted
- Addressed feedback from security penetration testing

**Deprecated**

- Microsoft Office 365 data source (based on GraphAPI) is deprecated, use
  Microsoft Exchange data source instead

**Upgrade Considerations**

- In order to enable BIST functionality on a workspace you will need to enable
  it via *TraceWorkspaceSettings* instance setting
- Data Sources that requires source folder now required to be within the
  default workspace fileshare base folder. You must adjust the Source Path
  settings for each impacted data source to be a relative folder path within
  the default file share configured for the workspace.

# 11.2.6.1 (17 June 2019)

**Features**

- Ability to overwrite GUID for Group Identifier field - some instances have
  non-standard Group Identifier field

**Enhancements**

- BIST now includes testing for email message with large number of email
  addresses (more than what OI can support at the moment)

**Defect Fixes**

- Data Extraction will include full email header information. Large header
  information was previous truncated due to OI bug
  
  -  > Relativity Viewer will still display truncated header
    information, however relativity fields (EmailTo, EmailFrom,
    EmailCC, EmailBCC will have full non-truncated data)
    {: .info }
- App Installation now will fail properly if expected Group Identifier fields is
  not present in the workspace

**Deprecated**
