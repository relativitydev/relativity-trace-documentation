## Installing Collect 

Before configuring the required instance settings and the Trace data source, install the Collect RAP to the Trace Workspace. You will do this from the Application Library in Relativity.

## Configuring instance settings 

Before configuring Trace data source, configure the following instance settings: 

- Configure Collect Queue Depth: 

- **Name**: MaxNumberOfRunningStandaloneCollections 
- **Section**: Relativity.Collection 
- **Value Type**: Integer 32-bit 
- **Value**: 10

Configure Data Batch Automatic Retry Policy: 

- **Name**: TraceWorkspaceSetting 
- **Section**: Trace.Workspace 
- **Value Type**: Text 
- **Value**: “DataBatchRetryIntervals”:[10,30,60]

Toggle On/Off Auto Batch Split functionality: 

- **Name**: EnableCollectDataBatchSplit. 
- **Section**: Trace.Workspace. 
- **Value Type**: True/False. 
- **Value**: False (auto split disabled) or True (auto split enabled).

## Configuring the Trace data source

To configure the Trace data source, perform the following steps. See the [Data Sources](https://relativitydev.github.io/relativity-trace-documentation/docs/administrator_guide/collection/data_sources.html) documentation for details on any of the settings included below.

1. Enter the following information in the General section:
   - Name: - the name of the Data Source.
   - Data Source Type - select the Data Source Type.
     ![](media/Installing_and_configuring_Trace_data_sources/DataSourceType.png)
   - Ingestion Profile - Ingestion Profile used to load data from this Data Source.
   - Start Date and End Date - used to collect data for the specific collection period. Both dates are optional.
     - If both dates are provided, data will be collected between Start Date and End Date. If Ingestion State is later than Start Date, then data will be collected between Ingestion State and End Date.
     - If only Start Date is provided, data will be collected between Start Date and now. If Ingestion State is later than Start Date, then data will be collected between Ingestion State and now.
     - If only End Date is provided, data will be collected between Ingestion State and End Date.
     - If none of them is provided, data will be collected between Ingestion State and now.
   - Last Runtime (UTC)
   - Enabled Time
   - Disabled Reason
   - Status
   - Last Error Date
   - Last Error

2. Enter the following information in the **Advanced** section. This is only visible on the development layout.
   - Ingestion State - Last ingestion date. This parameter is only visible in the development layout.

3. Enter the following information on the **Credentials** section:
   - Username - see specific connector for more details.
   - Password - see specific connector for more details.
   - AIP Client Secret - not used.
   - EWS Client Secret - not used.
   - Application Secret - see specific connector for more details.
   - PGP Key - see specific connector for more details.
   - Passphrase - see specific connector for more details.

4. Select the appropriate **Data Source Console** action:
   - Enable/Disable Data Source: Enabled (or disables) data retrieval for this Data Source. Enabling a Data Source continues data retrieval from Ingestion State (the last run).
   - Reset Data Source: Disabled and resets this Data Source to retrieve from specified “Start Date”.
     - If Start Date is not present – data for this Data Source will be retrieved from now.
     - Data Source reset clearing Ingestion State parameter.
     - Depending on Import settings, resetting and re-enabling a Data Source could duplicate data in the Workspace.

5. Enter the following information in the **Data Source Specific Fields** section:
   - Frequency in Minutes - Data Batch duration. Check specific Data Source for recommended value.
   - Additional Criteria Json - not used.
   - Merge Batches During Cold Start - True (default) or False – When set to True, it will merge initial Data Batches into bigger chunks of data. See Data Retrieval for more details.
   - Max Number of Batches To Merge: 24 (default) – Number of Data Batches which will be merged when Merge Batches During Cold Start is set to True. See Data Retrieval for more details.
   - Collect Job Timeout in Minutes - 1440 (default) – Time interval after which a Data Batch will be moved from Retrieving to Abandoned state.
   - Number of Monitored Individual Per Job - 100 (default) – Internal parameter to tweak data retrieval performance. This parameter is available for non-chat Data Sources only. See specific Data Source for more details.
   - Collection Period Offset in Minutes - 0 (default) – Modify Collection Period by adding offset in minutes to both Start and End Date. This parameter is used to collect data that are available to be retrieved with some delay, for example, 24 hours.
   - Password Bank
   - Extraction Thread Count
   - Enrich Documents
   - Embedded File Behavior
   - Discover Monitored Individual
   - Include Monitored Individuals Not Linked To Data Source
   - Discover Monitored Individuals Ignore Case
   - Aip Application Id - not used.
   - Aip Tenant Id -  not used.
   - Last Error Retention In Hours
   - Excluded File Transformation Enabled.
   - Health Check Failure Window Length In Minutes - when set, specifies time after which a Data Source is auto-disable due to no data/natives retrieved. If empty, a Data Source will never be auto-disabled.

Note: This parameter does not apply to "processing type of Data Source" - the Data Source which has "Only Retrieve Natives And Copy To Folder" configured. In that case, the parameter value should be empty.

6. Enter information for the **Trace Monitored Individuals**. This configures which monitored individual’s data should be retrieved from the data source.

7. Enter information for the **Data Transformations**. Determines which data transformations to apply to documents prior to ingestion into Relativity by this data source.
