## Requirements 

Before using this data source, note the following license requirements, version support, and special considerations.

### License requirements

The following licenses are required to use this data source:

- Microsoft 365 E3 or higher is required.
  - If you are using Microsoft 365 E3, you also need to add the Compliance module. 

### Versions supported

We support Microsoft 365 Enterprise 3 and above.

### Considerations

Note the following considerations about this data source:

#### Mailbox Collection
- The connector supports accessing active and licensed mailboxes. It does not support accessing inactive and archived mailboxes. 
  - Archived collection will be included in a future release. 
- You can collect from unlicensed custodians, but the mailbox must still be active in the case where the user is unlicensed.
- Guest mailboxes can only be collected if they are active & licensed.
- Shared mailboxes can only be captured if they are active.

#### Email Collection
- The connector collects all items in visible folders within Outlook’s inbox and custom folders. 
- Deleted items can be collected. 
- Deleted items from deleted folder (deleted and purged items) can be collected. Users must set their "Deleted items retention" to at least 14 days (Microsoft default). 
- Hidden folders cannot be collected. 

#### Email Content
- Formatted text is captured as plain text. 
- Numbered rows are captured as a single line. 
- Emojis are collected as plain text. 
  
#### Data Filtering
- There are two levels of filtering data: 
  - Data Source - only data linked to a Data Source Monitored Individuals will be captured. 
  - Data Batch - only messages which have “Date Received” within Data Batch collection period will be captured. 

## Information captured 

This section lists what activities and, if applicable, metadata are captured when you use this data source.

### Activities captured

The following table lists activities captured by this data source:

| Activity                    | Notes                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Messages with attachments   | A participant is only captured if they wrote a message.      |

| Activity not captured            | Notes                                                        |

| Participant removed from channel | A participant who leaves or is removed from a channel event is not captured. The participant is captured only if they wrote a message |
| Distribution lists               | A distribution list itself is not a mailbox.                 |

## Setup instructions

This section provides details on the prerequisites and steps for setting up this data source.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following in order to complete the setup instructions for this data source.

#### Standard prerequisites

You must have Collect installed in the workspace to set up this data source, since Collect will be used for data retrieval. 

For details on installing Collect, see [Collect]().

#### Company specific

You must have the following company-provided information to complete the authentication steps that precede setting up the data source:

- Access to the Azure portal and an active account
- A Client Secret
- An O365 domain name
- An Application / Client ID

#### Data transfer

You must have the following information to complete the data transfer.

- An application ID
- A Client secret
- An O365 domain name

### Authentication

Before configuring the data source complete the following authentication steps. We strongly recommend registering a separate Azure Application for each Data Source.

To register your app:
1. Open your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 
1. Click **More Services**. 
1. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**. 
1. In the left-navigation menu, click **App registrations**. 
1. Click **New Registration**. This will open the Register an application page. 
1. Enter an application name in the **Name** field. 
1. Select **Accounts** in this organizational directory only as the supported account type. 
1. Enter the redirect URL, http://localhost/ or https://localhost/, as the sign-on URL. 
1. Click **Register**. For more information on registering an application in Azure, see [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). 

 From the app's page, add permissions to the web API: 
1. Click **API Permissions**. 
2. Click **Add a permission**. 
3. Click **Microsoft Graph**. 
4. Select **Application Permissions**. 
5. Select the following options from the **Application Permissions** section: 
   - **Mail** - Read. 
   - **User** - Read.All 
   - **Calendars** - Read. For the Email only option, this permission is not needed 

6. Click **Add permissions**. 
7. Click **Grant Permission**. 

 Grant Admin consent for the API: 
1. Click the **API Permissions** tab. 
2. Click **Grant admin consent** for [tenant]. 
3. In the pop-up window, click **Accept**. If you do not have the ability to grant Admin consent for application permissions, you will need to find an Admin that can consent. 
4. Once clicked, the window will show all permissions granted. 
5. Verify all permissions have been granted. 
6. Click **Accept** to grant the permissions. 

Generate Client Secret:
1. In the left navigation menu, select **Certificates & secrets**. 
2. Select **New client secret**. 
   ![](media/Office_365_email_and_calendar_via_Collect/ClientSecret.png)
3. Enter a description in the **Description** text box. 
4. Set the expiration time frame to **Never**. 
5. Click **Add**. 
6. Click on the clipboard and copy secret to clipboard to paste in your text document. 
    - You should copy the secret and save it, as you will need it to set up your data sources in Trace. Microsoft will only show this secret this one time; there is no way to recover a secret if it is forgotten or lost. Make a note of the Application ID that Microsoft assigned to the app registration. This ID is also required for setup of data sources in Trace. 
    - You will need the following information to complete setup of the data source from the Trace front end: 
      - Application ID 
      - Client Secret (copy the **Value** field) 
      - Domain (mycompanydomain.com)

Limit the access of Relativity Collect to specific Microsoft user accounts and mailboxes by using the New-ApplicationAccessPolicy Powershell cmdlet. For more information, see [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-limit-mailbox-access).
