### Setup in Trace

The following sections provide the steps for installing the VerQu On-Premises Application to collect the data locally, how to use a data transfer method for moving data to RelativityOne, and how to configure the data source in Relativity Trace.

#### VerQu On-Premises Application for Data Collection

1. Navigate to the [Using VerQu]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/general_data_source_information/using_verqu.md %}) and install, configure, and schedule VerQu.

Some data source specific configuration is required while following the [Using VerQu]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/general_data_source_information/using_verqu.md %}) steps. That configuration can be found below.


1. Locate the **EnterpriseVault.json** file

1. Use the table below as a guide to update the values within that file.

      | Setting                           | Notes                                                        |
      | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
      | **Temp**                          | Folder path where temporary data might be placed             |
      | **Mailboxes**                     | Path to Trace Shipperâ€™s monitored_individuals.csv file. <br />Refer to TODO  to understand what timestamp will be used for the data for newly added monitored individuals |
      | **Server**                        | Specify the exact URL used when connecting to exchange server. |
      | **Username**                      | Specify login to admin account on exchange server            |
      | **Password**                      | Specify password to admin account on exchange server         |
      | **Logname**                       | A local file path where the log files for the application should be stored. Log path should always end with "verqu-{datetime}.log" |
      | **Destination**                   | The locally accessible path of the folder that needs to ship files from the Exchange server (note that the user running the service must have access) |
      | **DataRangeStart / DataRangeEnd** | This contains information on the start date of the first run |
      | **ConnectionString**              | This a standard SQL Server connection string that support all possible ways of connecting to SQL Server, including Windows Authentication and SQL Server Authentication |

1. Save the .json configuration files and navigate back to the [Using VerQu]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/general_data_source_information/using_verqu.md %}) documentation to complete the steps to configure VerQu.

### Data Transfer

[Shipper]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/shipper.md %}) will be used to transfer on-premises data collected by the VerQu application to Relativity Trace in the cloud.

### Data Source

Use the "Setting Up Data Sources in Relativity" section of the [Shipper]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/shipper.md %}) documentation to configure the Data Source.
