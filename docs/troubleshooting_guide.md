Relativity Trace Troubleshooting Guide
================================

*Note: most issues below are purely Relativity issues and must be resolved
before running Trace*

| Issue ID | Issue Symptoms                                               | Resolution                                                   | Notes                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | System.Exception: Cannot send email because EmailTo OR EmailFrom values are empty. Update EmailTo/Recepients and EmailFrom instance setting OR provide settings for Reporting task for this workspace | Update instance settings for *kCura.Notification* section, or update Reporting task settings.    |                                                              |
| 2        | Your search couldn't run at this time. Contact your system administrator -OR- System.Exception: Error during CreateAndPopulateCacheTable for Insight ---\> kCura.dtSearch.MSSQL.Exception.SearchRequestHasTimedOutException: Your search request has timed out, please contact your system administrator | Check that port entered in instance setting *SearchAgentServicePort* is unblocked on the Agent Server where dtSearch Search Agent is installed. Port needs to allow inbound and outbound connections. | Usually port number is *6870*                                |
| 3        | Relativity.Services.Exceptions.ServiceException: An unexpected server error occurred: | Ensure that all Agent Servers have *kCura Service Host Manager* service running | Check if *kCura Service Host Manager* (Kepler) is having issues communicating with Secret Store |
| 4        | System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Could not allocate space for object … filegroup is full | Update the storage allocation for the database. Make sure enable *Autogrowth* so this issue never happens again | https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/33700/primary-filegroup-is-full-sql-server-2008 |
| 5        | Relativity REST Calls return “500” and message “An Error Has occurred” | Restart IIS                                                  |                                                              |
| 6        | Web Package Manger Offline Builder for Service Bus. “Object reference is not set to an instance of an object” when using WebPI 5.0. | Use offline builder files supplied by Relativity. Online builder is currently broken and is not able to be used to perform offline installations. Offline installer files are currently stored on an Anexsys USB. |                                                              |
| 7        | Service Bus configuration would not run. Timeout error occurred when creating databases for Service Bus | SQL Server session hangs when you try to enable snapshot isolation in SQL Server 2016. Stop the audit on the SQL server; 1. Run the following SQL command; ALTER SERVER AUDIT AuditName WITH (STATE = OFF) 2. Run Service Bus configuration wizard again 3. Enable SQL Server Audit; ALTER SERVER AUDIT AuditName WITH (STATE = ON) https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4090966/sql-server-session-hangs-when-you-try-to-enable-snapshot-isolation If the databases are partly created, it will be required to drop the databases that were created during the first attempt. The databases are created in Single User mode, so you will be unable to delete them straight away. To get them out of single user mode, we need to identify the process ID that is locking the database. To do this, run the following SQL; exec sp_who Scroll through the list of returned results, and identify the corresponding ID for the Service Bus databases (prefixed with SB). Kill the process that is locking the database in Single User mode by running the following SQL in SSMS: KILL (ID). Replace (ID) with the process ID number identified in the first step. The databases will now be able to be deleted by right clicking the databases in SSMS and choosing ‘Delete’. |                                                              |
|          | IIS Application Pool for Relativity and Relativity.REST would not stay up | Add Relativity Service account to the ‘Allow Logon as Batch Job’ Local Group. |                                                              |
| 8        | Schannel SSL – Could not ping the secret store & event viewer suggests Schannel SSL errors | Two-part process to fix: <br>**Step 1** Enable Secure Crypto (TLS 1.2), by running the following in an Elevated Powershell; <br>\# set strong cryptography on 64 bit .Net Framework (version 4 and above)<br> `Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\.NetFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -Value '1' -Type DWord` <br># set strong cryptography on 32 bit .Net Framework (version 4 and above)<br> br>`Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NetFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -Value '1' -Type DWord` <br>**Step 2** Download IISCrypto to the server you want to configure - https://www.nartac.com/Products/IISCrypto/ <br>- Click Best Practices <br>- Uncheck TLS 1.0 and 1.1 <br>- Uncheck Triple DES 168/168 <br>- Uncheck MD5 - Uncheck SHA Reboot server |                                                              |
| 9        | Agent/Worker Installation – occasional issue with installation failing. Logs indicate this is due to a dependency issue, but do not state which package is causing the problem. | Install Visual C++ redistributable 2015 (x86 & x64), then reboot the server and retry the installation. Installers can be downloaded from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145 |                                                              |
| 10       | Some applications fail to upgrade during installation – error logs indicate an issue populating full text catalog, and SQL Full-text Filter Daemon Launcher service fails to start with “logon failure” error message | --Reconfigure the SQL Full-text Filter Daemon Launcher service to run under the Relativity service account, restart the service.<br>--Rebuild the full text catalog for all databases.<br>--Rerun the failed application upgrades from the Relativity frontend. |                                                              |
| 11       | Integration Points Application fails to install (failed install might still show Integration Points in workspace, creating a new Integration Point Profile will not be possible because Type field will have no options available). Specific error message might be “Could not create provider of type kCura.IntegrationPoints.DocumentTransferProvider.DocumentTransferProvider”. | Ensure WebAPIPath instance settings is setup for kCura.IntegrationPoints section. This needs to be a fully qualified URL. Going to the URL in a browser should not return a 404, it will probably be a 403 because you cannot navigate directly to the API URL. | WebApi path should not contain localhost in multi-server instances. Look at other WebApi path Instance Settings for examples of proper values. |
| 12       | Integration Point fails with 404 for HTTP or HTTPS call      | Ensure WebAPIPath instance settings is setup for kCura.IntegrationPoints section | WebApi path should not contain localhost in multi-server instances. Look at other WebApi path Instance Settings for examples of proper values. |
| 13       | Error: SQL Statement Failed ---Additional Errors--- Error: Subquery returned more than 1 value.

If the query is SqlService.CheckoutDocuments - ensure TraceCheckout index is created on Document table | CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [IX_TraceCheckout] ON [EDDSDBO].[Document] ( [TraceCheckout] ASC ) WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, SORT_IN_TEMPDB = OFF, DROP_EXISTING = OFF, ONLINE = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON) ON [PRIMARY] |
| 18       | Relativity.API.Exceptions.SecretStoreException: Secret Store set request failed. ---\> Relativity.SecretStore.Client.Exceptions.FailedHttpRequestException: Exception of type 'Relativity.SecretStore.Client.Exceptions.FailedHttpRequestException' | Check disk space on the server where secret service is running on. Specifically, the audit may not be able to be created in SQL server on each action executed against SecretStore |                                                              |
